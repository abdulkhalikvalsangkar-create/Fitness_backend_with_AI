"""Personal risk matching (arch.md 8.6).

Rule match against `UserContext`: declared allergies with cross-reactant
expansion, conditions, pregnancy status, age band, dietary restrictions.

This is the part where a miss is a real harm, so it is deliberately biased
toward flagging: a substring match on a declared allergy fires even when the
ingredient did not resolve to a chemical id. An unresolved token that contains
the word the user is allergic to still gets flagged.
